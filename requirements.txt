# Sketch the requirements for the game

Requirements:
Grid of arbitrary dimension: Dimension X Dimension
Percent of Grid to be a bomb

Two ways to populate the bombs:
1. Have first click protected, so generate bombs after first click
2. Generate the bombs before the first click

This game is going to be done through the terminal so user will have to
specify squares via text  e.g. A1

When a player selects a square, the game needs to first see if the square has a bomb.
If it does, reveal the map and end the game.
If it does not, then see how many bombs surround it
If no bomb surround it, then mark the square as blank, and traverse to each node that surrounds it
I'm going to include diagonals in this case

Best way to represent this?  I think a nice way would be to use a dictionary since I can
access the position a user chooses by looking at the value at the key.

Question is: how do I represent keys for arbitrarily sized dimensions?
I think the best way is to have the x dimension followed by a colon then the y dimension

I'm going to allow the first click to be unknown so that the player doesn't lose immediately
but lets do that later since its more complicated

Problems with dictionary:
How do you print the dictionary? Its easier to print if its a grid since iteration is in order
